## To-do

- Create page with UI like Page.png
- Connect to Graphql server with sockets. API is located at https://sb-gql-mock-api.herokuapp.com/graphql
- Explore API via grahpiql interface and try to come up with queries and subscriptions you should use to fetch needed data
- Would be awesome if you use React, TypeScript and Graphql client (urql/apollo client etc)
- Listen to odds updates (eg. 1.48 -> 1.55) via sockets (Graphql client)
- Odds should be clickable (log selection data to console on click)
- For desktop UI just have a ligher gray in the background and have the content have a max-width

### Sidenotes

- `events` resolver respond with active events only
- Markets "1x2" expected to be shown on the page
- Your app will work in realtime and there some edge cases must be handled (see Edge Cases)

### Edge Cases

- if some event got update with empty markets inside then this event considered as suspended and other active event should be shown instead
- if some selection got update with `odds = null` then this selection should not be clickable and `-` sign should be rendered instead of number


### Tools

- React
- Typescript
- Graphql
- Graphql subscriptions (sockets)
- Maybe?: NextJs, Redux/Context API/Graphql client cache
